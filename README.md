# SE206-A3 Group 11 

## Instructions

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SOFTENG206-2021/assignment-3-and-project-team-11.git
cd assignment-3-and-project-team-11
code . # This will open a code editor, eventually we should provide a ./start.sh
```

## Code Guidelines
**Please write tests** if we have good test coverage we can avoid any bugs down the line.


Outside of this we use standard Java formatting for code. `camelCase` for variables and so on, as taught in class.

## Commit Guidelines

In all commits, please try to follow the [convention for commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification).

Ideally aim to push every commit you make, rather than accumulating a large number of commits before pushing, this helps to keep everyone on the same
codebase when collaborating. 

The exception for this is that you should not commit non-compiling code to the main branch. Open a new branch and 
commit to that instead.

## Use of Pull Requests
The use of pull requests is generally not required, but if you are going to be making breaking changes where the code may not compile as you are working on it 
please create a branch and execute a pull request to merge your changes back in once you have finished.

If you would prefer not to use branches, that is fine but ensure your code *always* compiles before committing.
