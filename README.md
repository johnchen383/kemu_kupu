## Spelling Wiz GUI

### Getting Started
Ensure that the required files are all available
- In one directory, there should be `runQuiz.sh`, `quiz.jar`, and `words/` directory.
- Within `words/` there should be a selection of csv files, *named* and stored in *identical format* to that found at the GitHub repository https://github.com/SOFTENG206-2021/assignment-3-and-project-team-11

To get started, ensure that executable permissions are given to the shell scripts `runQuiz.sh`
> chmod +x runQuiz.sh

Ensure that `JavaFX` external jar files are located at `/home/student/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/javafx`

Error warnings that `libcanberra and pixbuf don't exist` may be present. To get rid of these, run the following commands:
> sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf

> sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module

Run the code by executing the shell script `runQuiz.sh`
> ./runQuiz.sh
