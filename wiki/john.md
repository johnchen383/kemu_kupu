**<font size="5">Revisiting Workflow and Collaboration Methodology</font>**

*20-Sep, 2021.*
* Questions collated for client meeting tomorrow including the use of copyrighted assets, as well as the use of backend API calls for the project scope. Document attached on Notion.
* We recognise that working on delegated tasks and coordinating who codes what might not be the best practice going forward, both for code quality and collaboration.
* We plan to meet tomorrow to sort out how we are to deliver the MVP in a collaborative manner as well as incorporate client interests. Doing so will be difficult given the rather busy schedules this week with many internship interviews taking place.
* Other work done by members:
  * Design asset-ised and added to codebase.
  * Refactoring on `assets` directory required.
