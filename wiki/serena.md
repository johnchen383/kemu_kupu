**Revamped game screen implementation** 

*4 Oct, 2021.*
- Completed most of the new game screen design and other design modifications on Figma
- For the purposes of design and intuitive user flow, we decided to combine the components of showing how many letters in the word + the input text field into one component, by having one small input box for each letter 
- Had some group discussions on issues that may arise with this, potential solutions and potential implementation methods
- Built more FXML files based on the new Figma designs
